This Task is divided into further sub tasks, which are listed below.
1.	Study the SPI Transmitter and Receiver Working with signal waveforms.
2.	Clock generator Module (Input 100MHz to 10MHz output).
3.	Parallel to serial Shift Register (8 / 16 / 32 bits) using FSM.
4.	Combine Sub-Task 2 and 3 with Control logic to initiate Process and raise a Done flag after completion of process.
5.	Serial to parallel Shift Register (8 / 16 / 32 bits) using FSM.
6.	Combine Sub-Task 2 and 5 with Control logic to initiate Process and raise a Done flag after completion of process.
7.	Combine the tested module in task 2 & 3 and 4 for SPI Transmitter and Loop back data in tested module in task 2 & 5 and 6 for SPI Receiver. (Looped data should be matched).
